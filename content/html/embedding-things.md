Many types of media and other content can be embedded directly into an HTML page.

### Images

Embed an image in a page.

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="alt text" width="500px" height="200px" />
```

![I'm a web site](../images/im-a-website.jpg)

The ```<img>``` tag has many attributes. All of them are optional except the ```src``` which defines the path or source of the image. If ```width``` and ```height``` are omitted the image will default to the actual image size. 

The ```alt``` (alt text) attribute is important for users who use screen readers (please don't ignore these people!). The alt text should be a short description of what the image is trying to convey. For example the alt text for the above image would be **Ralph Wiggum waves in front of school lockers believing he's a web page**. 

Search engines like alt text as well. If you are looking for a place to add more keywords for your content, alt text is a good place. 

Another helpful attribute is ```loading```. If you set the loading attribute to **lazy** ```loading="lazy"``` then the image will not be loaded until the users scrolls down to the image. This is helpful for pages with lots of images because the content will load faster and all page functionality will be available sooner because the page doesn't have to wait to load a large number of images. Images are typically the largest files and take the longest to download.

### Iframes (Inline Frame)

Iframes allow you to embed content from another website into your own. An iframe is an independent HTML document that is isolated from the page it's embedded on. You cannot manipulate the contents of an iframe with CSS or Javascript. That is one of the valid purposes to use an iframe â€” to provide a measure of separation between your application and the iframe content.

Typically you won't just embed another website into yours, in fact most websites will not allow you to embed their website for security reasons. Most of the uses for iframes are for third party widgets like ads, youtube videos, tweets, or instargram posts.

```
 <iframe src="https://some-website.com" title="description" width="100%" height="500px" allow="fullscreen" ></iframe> 
```

It is a good practice to include a title attribute for the ```<iframe>```. This is used by screen reader users to describe the content of the iframe.

The ```allow``` attribute is currently experimental and only supported by Chromium-based browsers. It lets you allowlist specific features like letting the iframe access to the accelerometer, the battery information, the camera, or in this case to go full screen. There are more than 25 available flags.

### Audio

There's an audio player right in your browser.

```
<audio controls>
    <source src="audio-sample.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    <source src="audio-sample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
```

The ```controls``` attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume. Without the controls attribute audio will not autoplay you would need javascript to control the audio. You add the ```autoplay``` attribute to autoplay the audio, but users tend to find anything happening automatically annoying. 

The ```<source>``` element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the ```<audio>``` and ```</audio>``` tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the ```<audio>``` element.

### Video

There's a video player in your browser as well.

```
<video width="320" height="240" poster="placeholder.png" controls>
    <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> 
```

The ```controls``` attribute works the same way at audio where the browser will load its own player with controls.

The ```placeholder``` attribute loads a custom placeholder image. If there's not placeholder the player will load the first frame of the video by default.

It is a good idea to always include ```width``` and ```height``` attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The ```<source>``` element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the ```<video>``` and ```</video>``` tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the ```<video>``` element.
