Let's create our own basic web page and have some fun.

### What you'll need

1. A web browser of your choice
2. Visual Studio Code (installed during installfest)

### Our First Web Page

1. On your desktop create a folder and name it **jumpstart**.
2. Open **Visual Studio Code**
3. Inside **Visual Studio Code** open the **jumpstart** directory (File >> Open).
4. Inside **jumpstart** create a file named **index.html**.
5. Inside **index.html** add some text.
6. Open **index.html** in your web browser.

You should see this:

![index.html page](../images/index_dot_html.png)

You just made a web page!

### Use HTML

Now let's use some html. Spend the next fifteen minutes building the following wireframe in your index.html page.

Feel free to reference the [semantic elements](/html/semantic-elements/) page or the [basic elements](/html/basic-elements/) page.

If you need help with images use the [embedding things](/html/embedding-things/) page. If you need an image you can get one [here](https://pixabay.com/). To get the path to the image right click on it and choose "Copy Image Address" or "Copy Image Link".

### Build this wireframe

Elements in each box are its child elements.

### Let's Complete the Page

Next we'll put this all together into a complete web document. To your index.html file:
1. Add the doctype
2. Add ```<html>``` and ```<head>``` tags
3. Put the html content from the wireframe into a ```<body>``` tag
