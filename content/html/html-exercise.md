Let's create our own basic web page and have some fun.

### What you'll need

1. A web browser of your choice
2. Visual Studio Code (installed during installfest)
3. The repository created in the **Intro to Git & GitHub** workshop

### 1. Our First Web Page (We'll do this together)

#### The files

You should have a repo you created in yesterday's Github workshop. If you do please open the index.html inside Visual Studio Code file. 

If you cannot access that file do the following:

1. On your desktop create a folder and name it **building-blocks**.
2. Open **Visual Studio Code**
3. Inside **Visual Studio Code** open the **building-blocks** directory (File >> Open).
4. Inside **building-blocks** create a file named **index.html**.

Or use this sample repo [here](https://github.com/itserik0/building-blocks).

#### First step

1. Inside **index.html** add ```<p>some text</p>```.
2. Open **index.html** in your web browser.

You should see this:

![index.html page](../images/index_dot_html.png)

You just made a web page!

### 2. Let's Make a Complete Page

Let's start with a complete web document. To your index.html file:
1. Add the ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
2. Add ```<html>```,  ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` tags
   
<!-- 3. Put the html content from the wireframe into a ```<body>``` tag -->

### 3. Your turn

#### Build this wireframe

Now let's try some html. Spend the next 15-20 minutes building the following wireframe in your index.html page.

Feel free to reference the [semantic elements](/html/semantic-elements/) page or the [basic elements](/html/basic-elements/) page.

If you need help with images use the [embedding things](/html/embedding-things/) page. If you need an image you can get one [here](https://pixabay.com/). To get the path to the image right click on it and choose "Copy Image Address" or "Copy Image Link".

We'll do the first few elements together. If you get stuck [here's a completed version](https://jumpstart-frontend.netlify.app/html/sample-html-exercise.html) of this html exercise.

You could use generic content or make it fun by creating an actual web site. Like a *food blog*, *all about jellyfish* , or anything of your own choosing. It's up to you.
