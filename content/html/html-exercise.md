Let's create our own basic web page and have some fun.

### What you'll need

1. A web browser of your choice
2. Visual Studio Code (installed during installfest)

### 1. Our First Web Page

1. On your desktop create a folder and name it **jumpstart**.
2. Open **Visual Studio Code**
3. Inside **Visual Studio Code** open the **jumpstart** directory (File >> Open).
4. Inside **jumpstart** create a file named **index.html**.
5. Inside **index.html** add some text.
6. Open **index.html** in your web browser.

or go [here](https://github.com/itserik0/jumpstart-starter-repo)

You should see this:

You just made a web page!

### 2. Let's Make a Complete Page

Let's start with a complete web document. To your index.html file:
1. Add the ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
2. Add ```<html>```,  ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` tags
3. Put the html content from the wireframe into a ```<body>``` tag

### 3. Use HTML

Now let's use some html. Spend the next fifteen minutes building the following wireframe in your index.html page.

Feel free to reference the [semantic elements](/html/semantic-elements/) page or the [basic elements](/html/basic-elements/) page.

If you need help with images use the [embedding things](/html/embedding-things/) page. If you need an image you can get one [here](https://pixabay.com/). To get the path to the image right click on it and choose "Copy Image Address" or "Copy Image Link".

We'll do the first few elements together.

#### Build this wireframe

I would suggest instead of using generic content make it fun by creating an actual web site. Like a *food blog*, *all about jellyfish* , or anything of your own choosing.

Elements in each box are its child elements.
