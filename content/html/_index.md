# HTML

HTML stands for _Hyper Text Markup Language_. HTML provides a way of creating structured documents. These documents are built with elements delineated by tags. 

HTMl is not a programming language, it's a markup language made up of tags also called elements, like ```<span>``` or ```<div>```. 

Each of these ~142 elements are written using angle brackets. Tags such as ```<p>``` surround content 
```
<p>some text</p>
```
and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements 
```
<div>
    <h1>Page Title</h1>
</div>
```
These tags can be used for content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. Tags such as ```<img />```,  ```<input />```, ```<audio>``` directly introduce content into the page. 

Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML is used to construct a web page, not style or manipulate it. That will come later.
