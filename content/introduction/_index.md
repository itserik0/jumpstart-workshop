# Introduction

Thanks for attending the Jumpstart workshop: **Building Blocks of the Web**. This workshop looks at the basic building blocks of a web page. 

## What does this workshop cover?

The Building Blocks of the Web portion of the Jumpstart workshop is about **front end** web development. By front end we mean any language that is rendered by the web browser on your computer or personal device. Those are:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## What doesn't this workshop cover?

This workshop will not cover the "back-end" or server side languages of web development. Server-side languages are rendered on a web server and not by your computer. Servers _can_ live on your computer but the servers for the web sites we visit can live anywhere in the world. Server side language are used to dynamically display different data when needed, generally pulled out of a database also stored on the server and sent to the client to be displayed on the front-end via a browser.

You may have heard of programing languages like PHP, Python, Java, or C++ (there's a zillion of them). They are server side programming languages and these will be discussed in the Introduction to Databases & Web Dev Workshop workshop later this week.
