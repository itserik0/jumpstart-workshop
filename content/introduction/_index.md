# Introduction

This workshops is about the **Building Blocks of the Web**. It is meant to give you a basic understanding of front-end web development by learning the basic construction of a web page. 

There will be a lot of information and you probably won't retain all of it, but that's ok. This is meant to be a taste of what is available in front-end development. Mastering it doesn't happen in a 2 hour course. 

## What does this workshop assume?

I assume you are eager to learn more about front-end web development. All level of experience are welcome here, but we are approcaching this workshop assuming attendees have little, if any, web development experience. 

## What does this workshop cover?

The Building Blocks of the Web portion of the Jumpstart workshop focuses specifically on **front-end** web development. The front-end is what the user can see â€” the visual layout and interactivity of a web site. Front-end development consists of a combination of technologies: **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)**, **JavaScript** and **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**.

## What doesn't this workshop cover?

This workshop will not cover the **back-end** or server side languages of web development. Back-end or server-side languages build the infrastruture that supports the front-end. They are rendered on a web server and not by your computer (browser). Server side language are used to dynamically display different data when needed, generally pulled out of a database and stored on the server before they are sent to your browser.

You may have heard of programing languages like PHP, Python, Java, or C++ (there's a zillion of them). They are server side programming languages and these will be discussed in the Introduction to Databases & Web Dev Workshop workshop later this week.
